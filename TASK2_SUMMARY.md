## 🎯 Top 5 Key Insights

### 1. Account Ownership Growth Paradox (High Significance)
**Insight:** Steady growth from 14% to 49% over 13 years, but dramatic recent slowdown
**Evidence:** 2021-2024: Only +3pp growth despite 65M+ mobile money accounts
**Implication:** "Registered vs. Active" gap suggests measurement methodology issues

### 2. Infrastructure as Critical Enabler (High Significance)
**Insight:** Mobile and internet penetration strongly correlate with financial inclusion
**Evidence:** Mobile penetration doubled (+59.5%), Internet grew 16x (+1576%)
**Implication:** Infrastructure investment drives inclusion outcomes

### 3. Telebirr as Market Catalyst (High Significance)
**Insight:** Telebirr launch (2021) served as major digital finance accelerator
**Evidence:** 54M+ users achieved in 3 years, transformed competitive landscape
**Implication:** Local solutions can achieve rapid scale in emerging markets

### 4. Growth Deceleration Puzzle (High Significance)
**Insight:** Recent slowdown despite massive mobile money expansion
**Evidence:** 2021-2024: +3pp vs 2017-2021: +11pp growth
**Implication:** Market saturation, measurement gaps, or structural barriers

### 5. High Data Quality Foundation (Medium Significance)
**Insight:** Excellent data quality enables robust analysis
